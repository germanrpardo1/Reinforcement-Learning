# Reinforcement-Learning
Reinforcement learning course taken during my MSc degree at LSE.

Topics include:

1. Introduction to RL.
2. Foundations of reinforcement learning – Markov decision process, Bellman optimality equation, the existence of optimal stationary policy. Multi-armed Bandits, Optimistic Principle.
3. Dynamic programing and Monte Carlo methods  – policy evaluation, policy improvement, policy iteration, value iteration based on dynamic programming, and Monte Carlo methods for reinforcement learning, including Monte Carlo estimation and Monte Carlo control.
4. Temporal difference learning – temporal difference learning, temporal difference prediction, SARSA, Q-Learning and n-step temporal difference predictions, TD(lambda).
5. On-policy prediction and control with approximation – types of function approximators (value and action-value function approximator), gradient based methods for value function prediction, convergence guarantees with linear function approximator, and semi-gradient n-step SARSA. 
6. Q-learning type algorithms with function approximation – q-learning with linear function approximator, fitted q-iteration, deep q-network.
7. Policy gradient methods – policy approximation, REINFORCE, actor-critic methods that combine policy function approximation with action-value function approximation.
8. Model-Based Learning: Dyna-Q, Monte Carlo Tree Search, AlphaGo.
9. Batch off-policy evaluation – importance sampling-based method, doubly robust method, marginalized importance sampling.
10. Batch policy optimisation – recent advances in offline reinforcement learning algorithms.
